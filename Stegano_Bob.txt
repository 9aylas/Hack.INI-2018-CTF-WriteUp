My friend  Bob  is  too  strong  at  programming,  he  knows all  the

hash algorithms, he also knows  everything related  to  infosec which

is his  best domain  in computer science. His  favorite game  is CTF,

the game where there is challenges, and to solve them, you must find a

flag which is  a  strange string  that  can't  be  bruteforced at  all.




Read first word from lines and u get this 'My hash is the flag'
Hash the text file with md5 and go flag it :-)
